## Loan Prediction Based on Customer Behavior
 
Predict who possible Defaulters are for the Consumer Loans Product

# Research Background

An organization wants to predict who possible defaulters are for the consumer loans product. They have data about historic customer behavior based on what they have observed. Hence when they acquire new customers they want to predict who is riskier and who is not.

# Research Purpose

Based on historical data, our group explore the factors that influence default rate, such as job seniority, asset ownership and age range.

# Commercial Value

The research is helpful for enterprises to assess the risks of product delivery objects according to their attributes.

# Research Scope & Object

The data set covers 26 states around the world, including groups with an annual income between 10 thousands and 10 millions.
